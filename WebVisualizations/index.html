        The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes as you get closer to the
        equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API
        to assemble a datset on over 500 cities. 
      </p1>
      <p2> 
        After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the 
      weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperate, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity.
      This site provides the source data and visualizations creates as part of the analysis, 
      as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
